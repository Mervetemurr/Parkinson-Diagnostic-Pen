# Parkinson-Diagnostic-Pen
Parkinson disease is caused by the breakdown of cells that produce the substance called dopamine in the brain that allows brain cells
to communicate with each other. Cells that produce dopamine in the brain are responsible for the control, adaptation and fluency of movements. 
In this project, an angle-acceleration sensor was attached to the pen and the hand tremor intensity caused by the recognition was tried
to be determined. It is aimed to choose the diagnosis of the disease based on the tremor intensity. 
The person to be diagnosed was asked to make drawings with this reference. Sensor acceleration values are
recorded during drawing Based on the acceleration values measured by the sensor, the network was tried to give a diagnostic output.
